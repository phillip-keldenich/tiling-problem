# Installation
A standard installation with a sufficiently recent python version should work;
after cloning the repository, just running `pip install .` or `pip install -e .` 
for an editable install should be sufficient.


# Usage examples
You can consult the examples (including the example tileset) in the notebook `notebooks/playground.ipynb`.
